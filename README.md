My project involves visualizing the 2017 4-year graduation rates of all public high schools in the state of Michigan by location. In a sociology class I took last year, we discussed the reasons and implications behind high/low graduation rates. I wanted to analyze this at a state level (with a particular focus on the metro Detroit area) to determine any concentration of successful/unsuccessful high schools. There are a couple questions I wanted to answer:
- Where are the most notable areas that exhibit a large disparity in graduation rates?
- Are schools that have very high or very low graduation rates isolated to certain geographical areas? Or spread somewhat evenly across the state?
